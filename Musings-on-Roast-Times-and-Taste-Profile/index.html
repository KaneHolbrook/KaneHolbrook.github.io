        <p>I recently came across an interesting <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03670244.2012.706061#tabModule" target="_blank" rel="external">study</a> performed at the New University of Lisbon in Caparica, Portugal. The title of the study is <em>Impact of roasting time on the sensory profile of arabica and robusta coffee</em>. The study was composed of six ‘expert sensory panelists’, according to the ISO standard, who tasted arabica and robusta samples that had been roasted at 7, 9 and 11 minute intervals.  The coffee was roasted  at a temperature of 428 degrees.  The ISO standard was adhered to strictly for all of the processes along the way, which include: green coffee sourcing, roasting, coffee preparation and the sensory portion of the study.  The green coffee sourcing was also in compliance with the International Coffee Organization and the brewing procedure was patterned after the specifications laid out in Ted R. Lingle’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Coffee-Brewing-Handbook-Preparation/dp/1882552024" target="_blank" rel="external"><em>The Coffee Brewing Handbook: A Systematic Guide to Coffee Preparation</em>.</a><br>The arabica coffee is sourced from Brasil but exactly which part of Brasil and other coffee specifications are withheld from the reader.  It is also unclear what roaster is being used and if it is a fluid bed or drum roaster.  So, as with many of these studies, lots of questions, lots of suboptimal things about it.  But lets see if we can learn anything of substance.</p>
<p>I am most interested in the panels analysis of the arabica samples, though I am sure there is something to be learned from the robusta. It is just not in the scope of this article to deal with that.  One thing to note that was reiterated in this study at one point is the fact that there are compounds that are barely or not at all present in robusta that are present in arabica.  The most prominent example is that of cafestol, or kahweol.  But there also appear to be other volatile and semi volatile aromatic compounds that have a less observed presence in robusta than arabica that contribute significantly to the final cup.  This would indicate that the complexity of the arabica coffee from a culinary perspective is greater, not to mention the ratios of particular aromatic compounds differ in  a way that optimizes for a more favorable taste profile in arabicas, which is validated at the cupping table.</p>
<p>So lets look at the panel’s results concerning the arabica coffee brew samples of the coffee that had been roasted for 7, 9 and 11 minutes respecitively.  In order to synthesize this data in a more concise way I have put together a bar graph with the sensory areas evaluated on the x-axis and the values of those areas on the y-axis.  The blue bar corresponds to the 7 minute roast, orange to 9 minutes and gray to 11 minutes.</p>
<p><img src="/roastchart.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The bar graph looks much like we would expect.  We expect the longest roast (11 minutes) to correspond to highest burned aroma, burned taste, bitter flavor, astringency and body.  However, what I thought interesting is the order of magnitude of difference in negative cup characteristics compared to more positive or neutral characteristics.  The 11 minute roast had almost 7 times more burned aroma than the 9 minute, almost 4 times more burned taste and 2 times the bitter flavor than the 9 minute roast.  Astringency was even nearly 2 times as intense in the 11 minute as in the 9 minute.  Body was highest in the 11 minute roast but negligibly greater than that of the 9 minute roast.</p>
<p>The 7 minute roast scored lowest in all categories.</p>
<p>The 9 minute roast scored highest in citric acid aroma (but the difference from the 11 minute roast in this area was minute) and acid flavor.  The 9 minute roast clearly was the winner in the overall quality category.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway</strong><br>When all other things are equal, simply roasting longer does not appear to optimize for anything good in particular.  In fact, I would argue it optimizes for worse tasting coffee.  Merely roasting longer ushers in acrid cupping characteristics along with carcinogenic compounds (that could make good fodder for future writing).  I have heard many people over the years say to roast coffee used for espresso longer, so as to acheive more body, but that seems like it may be anecdotal advice.  At least if there is any factual evidence to this, there is a clear law of diminishing returns, where you sacrifice many favorable cup characteristics for the sake of a marginal optimization of body.<br>There are a lot of things this study does not do or claim to say about the roasting process, but I thought it was interesting data to look at and think about.  No one roasting craft coffee is dropping and roasting coffee at one constant temperature (i.e. 428 degrees) but there are probably some companies out there doing it and they probably package their coffee in single serve capsules.</p>
