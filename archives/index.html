        <p><strong>Acetic Acid</strong> -Contributes greatly to the percieved acid taste of coffee.  Has been implicated with a sour taste. </p>
<p><strong>Alanine</strong>-  An amino acid, but a nonessential one.  It is found in food especially meat.  It is has a greater presence in Arabica coffee than Robusta.</p>
<p><strong>Amino Acid</strong>- An organic compound that has an acid functional group and an amine functional group on adjacent carbon atoms. The building blocks of proteins and of life. </p>
<p><strong>Arabica</strong> -  A species of coffee indigenous to Ethiopia.  Has a higher sugar content than Robusta and a lower caffeine content.  Used more widely in specialty coffee because of sweeter and less bitter flavor compounds.</p>
<p><strong>Asparagine</strong>- A nonessential amino acid.  Reacts with reducing sugars to produce acrylamide.  Plays an important role in the nervous system.  Plays a role in coffee aroma formation.</p>
<p><strong>gamma butyrolactone</strong>-  A lactone with sweet aromatic properties.  Also found in wine.</p>
<p><strong>Chlorogenic Acid</strong>-  A powerful antioxidant found in high amounts in green coffee.  Has an inversely proportional relationship with quinic acid in the roasting process.</p>
<p><strong>Choline</strong>- Common in certain foods and an important chemical precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  Important for cell signaling.  Choline is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_ammonium_cation" target="_blank" rel="external">quat.</a></p>
<p><strong>Citric Acid</strong>- Found in citrus fruits (oranges, limes, grapefruits, lemons).  Contributes a sour acidic taste to coffee.  One of the most prominent acids that contribute to coffees acidity.</p>
<p><strong>Formic Acid</strong>-  Has been implicated with pungency. “It has a powerful, green-gerbaceous, rosy odr with some similarity to chrysanthemum, hyacinth and watercress foliage.  It has moderate to poor tenacity(Arctander, 1967).”(Flament, I. (2002). Coffee Flavor Chemistry. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.) </p>
<p><strong>2-furylmethanol</strong>- It has a very mild, slightly caramellic, warm-oily odor (Arctander, 1967) and is well correlated with the undesirable burnt and bitter note of dark-roasted coffees.  Its flaove threshold in water was 5 ppm for Brule et al. (1971) who found a slight taste of smoked meat.(Flament, I. (2002). Coffee Flavor Chemistry. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.)</p>
<p><strong>Gas Chromatography</strong>- chromatography in which the sample mixture is vaporized and injected into a stream of carrier gas (as nitrogen or helium) moving through a column containing a stationary phase composed of a liquid or particulate solid and is separated into its component compounds according to their affinity for the stationary phase(<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.merriam-webster.com/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Lactic Acid</strong>- Present in milk products and also gives sourdough its “sour” flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Spectrometry</strong>- It ionizes atoms or molecules by bombarding them with electrons.  Then the particles are accelerated and introduced to a magnetic field.  The mass to charge ratio can be calculated and then the size and hence properties of the atom or molecule can be ascertained.</p>
<p><strong>Nicotinic Acid</strong>- Has a relationship to trigonelline in the roasting process.  A vitamin that is found in milk, liver and yeast.</p>
<p><strong>N-methylpyridinium</strong>-  A degradation compound of trigonelline.</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</strong>- It uses the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to ascertain detailed information about the molecule.  Used commonly in organic chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Polysaccharides</strong>- Carbohydtrate molecules that contribute to “body” in coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Robusta</strong>- Indigenous to Central and Western Africa.  Has a higher crop yield than Arabica.  Higher cherry clustering than Arabica and less sugars per seed.</p>
<p><strong>Sucrose</strong>- Sugar. Odorless but oh so sweet in taste.</p>
<p><strong>Trigonelline</strong>-Highly present in green coffee.Found in higher levels in Arabica coffee. The<br> thermal degradation of trigonelline creates many aromatic compounds.  Trigonelline does not contribute much to the extracted cup itself although the compounds it degrades into contribute both unpleasant and pleasant flavor characteristics. The content in green coffee is .6-1% observed by Hughes and Smith (1946).</p>
<p><strong>Quinic Acid</strong>- Is created by the degradation of chlorogenic acid.  Contributes to acidity and pleasant bitters in coffee.  Not as heavy a contributor as acetic, citric and malic acids.</p>
<p><strong>Volatile Organic Compounds</strong>- These are organic compounds that have a low boiling point.  Much of what contributes to odor and flavor in coffee are VOC’s.  Many VOC’s are released in the brewing process (aromatics) while many of them remain left behind in the liquid solution (flavors).  When you inhale the headspace (the aromatic space just above a cup of coffee) you are getting an onslaught of VOC’s.</p>
