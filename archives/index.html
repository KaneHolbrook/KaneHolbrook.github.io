        <p>On the surface, coffee may not seem to have much to do with nuclear spin and magnets. But leave<br>it to science to bring seemingly disparate things together. Remember <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119137/" target="_blank" rel="external">flubber?</a> In a similar vein (with<br>less Hollywood and more University of Tokyo) an <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22224944" target="_blank" rel="external">excellent study</a> was conducted using<br><a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)</a> to observe the roasting process of coffee. The study monitored<br>30 NMR- visible components, tracking them during the roasting process. Tracking coffee this way is<br>not super easy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_processing" target="_blank" rel="external">Signal processing</a> is done to identify particular components in the coffee and then<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_analysis" target="_blank" rel="external">multivariate statistical analysis</a> is used to model the behavior of these components.</p>
<p>Many of the findings from this study corroborated other research where <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Gas Chromatography</a> or <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mass Spectrometry</a> was used for observation. For example, the Univervisty of Tokyo researchers confirmed<br>that <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">sucrose</a> and <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">chlorogenic acid</a> degrade into <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">quinic acids</a> and <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">polysaccharides</a>. But the beauty of<br>this study is that it is a very in-depth look at the changes of the chemical components of coffee throughout the roast.</p>
<p>In terms of the type of coffee used in this analysis, all we know is that they were using <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Arabica</a> coffee<br>from Columbia. The coffee was roasted with a Hearthware home coffee roaster although the exact<br>model is not named. Likely it is Hearthware I-Roast that came onto to the market around 2004. It is<br>a fluid bed roaster and according to Tom at Sweet Maria’s it behaves much like a popcorn popper and<br>looks like this bad boy.<br><img src="/hearthware.jpg" alt=""><br>The coffee was roasted at 428 degrees farenheit (220 Celsius).</p>
<p>One of the most valuable parts of this study was a group of graphs that were created based on the<br>results. You find the integral value for the signal of a particular component on the y-axis with time of<br>the roast on the x-axis. This juxtaposition of component signatures gives us a great visualization for<br>understanding what the individual components are doing during the roasting process.</p>
<p><img src="/graphs.jpg" alt=""><br><em>Figure 3. Evolutions of coffee components during the roasting process: (A) 1, 5-CQA; 2, 4-CQA; and 3, 3-CQA; (B) 1, quinic<br>acid; 2, γ-quinide; and 3, syllo-quinic acid; (C) sucrose; (D) 1, L-glutamic acid; 2, L-alanine; 3, L-asparagine; and 4, GABA; (E)<br>1, trigonelline; 2, N-methylpyridinium; and 3, nicotinic acid; (F) 1, citric acid; 2, malic acid; 3, lactic acid; 4, acetic acid; and<br>5, formic acid; (G) 1, β-(1−4)-D-mannopyranose; 2, α-(1−3)-Larabinofuranose; 3, α-(1−5)-L-arabinofuranose; 4, β-(1−3)-D-<br>galactopyranose; and 5, β-(1−6)-D-galactopyranose; and (H) 1, myo-inositol; 2, choline; 3, 2-furylmethanol; 4, γ-butyrolactone;<br>and 5, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. The integral value of the signal of caffeine was set to a constant of 100.</em></p>
<p>Lets dig into the results:</p>
<h4 id="Graph_A-_Chlorogenic_Acids">Graph A- <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Chlorogenic Acids</a></h4>
<p>5-CQA, 4-CQA and 3-CQA are types of chlorogenic acid. It has been posited that there are over 30<br>different types of chlorogenic acid in coffee but the NMR only showed 3 types. The researchers<br>commented that this is due to the more abundant presence of these three types and that the other 27<br>or so consist of more trace amounts. In coffee chemistry threshold values are very important, especially<br>when trying to sort your way through a thousand or more individual <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">volatile compounds</a>. Note the<br>very steady decrease of 5-CQA to roughly the 2 minute mark until 9 minutes where it looks like it is<br>completely degraded. Similar activity seems to be happening with the other chlorogenic acids with<br>3-CQA having a similar negative slope as 5-CQA. The chlorogenic acids in coffee are some of its most<br>powerful antioxidants but do not add anything pleasant to the cupping table. In fact, if a coffee still<br>has high amounts of chlorogenic acid after roasting, there will be considerable bitter and astringent<br>qualities.</p>
<h4 id="Graph_B_–_Quinic_Acids">Graph B – <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Quinic Acids</a></h4>
<p>One immediate observation is that the quinic acids tend to increase in signature as the chlorogenic acids<br>degrade, which fits with chemical observation of chlorogenic acid breaking down during the roasting<br>process into <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">caffeic acid</a> and quinic acid. This also comports with Flament in his Coffee Flavor Chemistry<br>when he states, “ In spite of the degradation of quinic acid, he (speaking of a scientist named Blanc from<br>a study in 1979) observed a relatively good linearity between the disappearance of chlorogenic acid and<br>the formation of quinic acid during roasting.” If the roasting process continued past what we have in<br>our current study we would begin to see the quinic acid start to degrade creating what would appear to<br>be an optimal roast level for certain types of quinic acids at peak levels.</p>
<h4 id="Graph_C_–_Sucrose">Graph C – Sucrose</h4>
<p>Sucrose takes a sharp nosedive during the roasting process and has completely degraded by around the<br>four minute mark. It has been observed by Baltes and Bachmann that sucrose degrades into <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">phenols</a><br>and <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">aliphatic</a> compounds. Others have called sucrose the aroma precursor in coffee because of all of<br>the compounds it generates that contribute to the overall odor and taste of the finished product.</p>
<h4 id="Graph_D_–_The_amino_acids">Graph D – The <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">amino acids</a></h4>
<p>Glutamic acid, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">alanine</a>,<a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">asparagine</a> and GABA are all completely degraded out by 4 minutes of roasting.<br>This is significant because amino acids make up proteins, which are necessary for the <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Maillard</a> reaction<br>that coffee undergoes during roasting, which would kick off around the 4 minute mark on this roaster.<br>But digging into the Maillard reaction will be for another time.</p>
<h4 id="Graph_E-_Trigonelline,_N-methylpyridinium,_Nicotinic_acid">Graph E- <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Trigonelline</a>, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">N-methylpyridinium</a>, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Nicotinic acid</a></h4>
<p>Trigonelline gets a lot of chatter in the coffee communities because we have known for a long time<br>that the breakdown of trigonelline creates some potentially desirable and undesirable final cup<br>characteristics. Trigonelline undergoes pyrolysis (degradation at high temperatures) and the byproduct<br>is many different compounds tasting anywhere from dry rotting wood to caramel to tobacco. N-<br>methylpyridinium and nicotinic acid are products of the pyrolysis of trigonelline so it makes sense that<br>they would slightly uptick as trigonelline decreases. They also have significance in the odor and taste of<br>the finished product.</p>
<h4 id="Graph_F_–_Citric_Acid,_Malic_Acid,_Lactic_Acid,_Acetic_Acid_and_Formic_Acid">Graph F – <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Citric Acid</a>, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Malic Acid</a>, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lactic Acid</a>, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Acetic Acid</a> and <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">Formic Acid</a></h4>
<p>This is a bit of a mixed group so we will unpack it a little. Citric Acid as most of you will recall, is found<br>in citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits). It is often used as a preservative and to add a sour<br>taste to certain food items. Citric Acid contributes highly to the perceived taste of acid in the final cup of<br>coffee. The presence of citric acid starts in green coffee as very prominent and around the four minute<br>mark we see it start to slowly make a negative linear descent. Then it appears to hold steady around 6<br>and a half minutes, having a much less dramatic slope downward through the end of the roast. </p>
<p>Malic acid, first isolated from apple juice is actually named from a derivative of the Latin word for apple.<br>It is known for contributing a tart or sour taste to foods and can be clearly tasted in rhubarb. It appears<br>to have a similar profile during the roast as citric acid, but in lower concentrations. </p>
<p>Lactic acid is mostly present in fermented milk products like yogurt, kefir, etc. It is also implicated with<br>giving sourdough bread its “sour” aroma and flavor. The presence of lactic acid in unroasted coffee<br>appears to be very low but throughout the roasting process looks to increase slightly and approach a<br>limit around the 6 to 6 and a half minute mark.</p>
<p>Acetic acid is next in the chart and Flament writes that “the odor is pungent, stinging sour, unpleasant<br>when concentrated, less repulsive below 15% in water (Arctander,1967)”. It has a very interesting<br>behavior as it ramps up and peaks around the 4 minute mark and holds very steady throughout the rest<br>of the roasting process. It does appear to slowly be degrading from minutes 5-9 and likely continues<br>that trajectory if roasted into later stages. </p>
<p>Formic acid has a very similar profile shape to acetic acid but peaks higher and descends faster. It has<br>been implicated with pungency in odor. It is also found in ant venom.</p>
<p>In his Coffee Flavor Chemistry, Flament, commenting on a study done in the late eighties, writes “Maier<br>calculated the sensory effective part of acids in several samples of Robusta and Arabica commercial<br>blends and coffee extracts. In all groups, acetic, citric and malic acid were the most important for the<br>acid taste. It is astonishing that quinic, formic and chlorogenic acids, present in relatively large amounts,<br>do not contribute much to the acid taste.”</p>
<h4 id="Graph_G_–_The_Polysaccharides">Graph G – The Polysaccharides</h4>
<p>Polysaccharides in coffee are mostly present in the cellular structure of the coffee seed though they<br>do have implications for the finished product. Polysaccharides contribute to the body of a coffee and<br>behave curiously, especially mannopyranose. All other polysaccharides peak around the 4 minute mark<br>and then fall slowly as the roast finishes, except mannopyranose, which continues to climb strongly<br>throughout the roasting process.</p>
<h4 id="Graph_H_–_Myoinositol,_choline,_2-furylmethanol,_y-butyrolactone,_5-hydroxymethylfurfural">Graph H – Myoinositol, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">choline</a>, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">2-furylmethanol</a>, <a href="http://kaneholbrook.github.io/glossary-of-terms/" target="_blank" rel="external">y-butyrolactone</a>, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural</h4>
<p>Myoinositol and choline only tend to faintly decrease throughout the roasting process. </p>
<p>2-furylmethanol has no to low presence in green, unroasted coffee and peaks here at the 6 minute<br>mark, then flatlines until the end of the roasting process. 2-furylmethanol has gotten mixed reviews on<br>its pleasantness factor in roasted coffee, not surprisingly, as with many of these compounds it greatly<br>depends on how much of its concentration is present.</p>
<p>Gamma Butyrolactone, besides being used for commercial purposes as a superglue remover, Flament<br>writes, “This widely distributed and common aroma constituent has a faint, sweet-aromatic odor<br>(Arctander, 1967).” It also peaks around the 6 to 6 and a half minute mark and continues steady<br>throughout the roasting process. </p>
<p>5-Hydroxymethylfurfural is generated in food by the heating process. About this compound Flament<br>writes “The odor is warm-herbaceous, winey-ethereal, remotely resembling that of Hungarian<br>chamomile (matricaria oil). The flavor is sweet, herbaceous, hay-like, mildly tobacco-like (Arctander,<br>1967). The flavor threshold is 100 ppm in water as determined by Brule et al. (1971) who found that it<br>gave a mouldy, bitter taste depending on the concentration.”</p>
<h4 id="The_Takeaway">The Takeaway</h4>
<p>The underlying chemical roasting and cupping correlates continue to be drawn thicker everyday.  While research like this is being done in chemistry laboratories, similar research is being done by roasters and cuppers in the specialty coffee world.  At some point in time these two worlds need to shake hands in a more robust way.  In a way that allows us to understand coffee chemistry from soil to siphon brew. It is to that end that roasters and cuppers can use this data. To enhance their coffee experience and assist them in going back and forth from the cupping table to the roaster, to try and optimize for the presence of certain components.  While there are many answers in this study, there are also lots of questions that remain unanswered. For example what, if anything, happens with coffee chemistry in a drum roaster that is uniquely different than a fluid<br>bed roaster? Or, what if we change the roast curve just a little and try to optimize for the presence of say, acetic acid? Or what is the deal with mannypyranose and why does it behave different than the other<br>polysaccharides? Through research like this study, we are learning a lot about the individual semi<br>volatile and volatile organic compounds that make coffee so flavorful. However, it may take many more<br>years before we fully grasp the benefit of this data at the farmer, roaster and barista level. That is<br>where the rubber hits the road and we need roaster scientists to do much of this heavy lifting.</p>

        <p><strong>Acetic Acid</strong> -Contributes greatly to the percieved acid taste of coffee.  Has been implicated with a sour taste. </p>
<p><strong>Alanine</strong>-  An amino acid, but a nonessential one.  It is found in food especially meat.  It is has a greater presence in Arabica coffee than Robusta.</p>
<p><strong>Amino Acid</strong>- An organic compound that has an acid functional group and an amine functional group on adjacent carbon atoms. The building blocks of proteins and of life. </p>
<p><strong>Arabica</strong> -  A species of coffee indigenous to Ethiopia.  Has a higher sugar content than Robusta and a lower caffeine content.  Used more widely in specialty coffee because of sweeter and less bitter flavor compounds.</p>
<p><strong>Asparagine</strong>- A nonessential amino acid.  Reacts with reducing sugars to produce acrylamide.  Plays an important role in the nervous system.  Plays a role in coffee aroma formation.</p>
<p><strong>gamma butyrolactone</strong>-  A lactone with sweet aromatic properties.  Also found in wine.</p>
<p><strong>Chlorogenic Acid</strong>-  A powerful antioxidant found in high amounts in green coffee.  Has an inversely proportional relationship with quinic acid in the roasting process.</p>
<p><strong>Choline</strong>- Common in certain foods and an important chemical precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  Important for cell signaling.  Choline is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternary_ammonium_cation" target="_blank" rel="external">quat.</a></p>
<p><strong>Citric Acid</strong>- Found in citrus fruits (oranges, limes, grapefruits, lemons).  Contributes a sour acidic taste to coffee.  One of the most prominent acids that contribute to coffees acidity.</p>
<p><strong>Formic Acid</strong>-  Has been implicated with pungency. “It has a powerful, green-gerbaceous, rosy odr with some similarity to chrysanthemum, hyacinth and watercress foliage.  It has moderate to poor tenacity(Arctander, 1967).”(Flament, I. (2002). Coffee Flavor Chemistry. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.) </p>
<p><strong>2-furylmethanol</strong>- It has a very mild, slightly caramellic, warm-oily odor (Arctander, 1967) and is well correlated with the undesirable burnt and bitter note of dark-roasted coffees.  Its flaove threshold in water was 5 ppm for Brule et al. (1971) who found a slight taste of smoked meat.(Flament, I. (2002). Coffee Flavor Chemistry. West Sussex, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.)</p>
<p><strong>Gas Chromatography</strong>- chromatography in which the sample mixture is vaporized and injected into a stream of carrier gas (as nitrogen or helium) moving through a column containing a stationary phase composed of a liquid or particulate solid and is separated into its component compounds according to their affinity for the stationary phase(<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.merriam-webster.com/</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Lactic Acid</strong>- Present in milk products and also gives sourdough its “sour” flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Mass Spectrometry</strong>- It ionizes atoms or molecules by bombarding them with electrons.  Then the particles are accelerated and introduced to a magnetic field.  The mass to charge ratio can be calculated and then the size and hence properties of the atom or molecule can be ascertained.</p>
<p><strong>Nicotinic Acid</strong>- Has a relationship to trigonelline in the roasting process.  A vitamin that is found in milk, liver and yeast.</p>
<p><strong>N-methylpyridinium</strong>-  A degradation compound of trigonelline.</p>
<p><strong>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</strong>- It uses the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to ascertain detailed information about the molecule.  Used commonly in organic chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Polysaccharides</strong>- Carbohydtrate molecules that contribute to “body” in coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Robusta</strong>- Indigenous to Central and Western Africa.  Has a higher crop yield than Arabica.  Higher cherry clustering than Arabica and less sugars per seed.</p>
<p><strong>Sucrose</strong>- Sugar. Odorless but oh so sweet in taste.</p>
<p><strong>Trigonelline</strong>-Highly present in green coffee.Found in higher levels in Arabica coffee. The<br> thermal degradation of trigonelline creates many aromatic compounds.  Trigonelline does not contribute much to the extracted cup itself although the compounds it degrades into contribute both unpleasant and pleasant flavor characteristics. The content in green coffee is .6-1% observed by Hughes and Smith (1946).</p>
<p><strong>Quinic Acid</strong>- Is created by the degradation of chlorogenic acid.  Contributes to acidity and pleasant bitters in coffee.  Not as heavy a contributor as acetic, citric and malic acids.</p>
